HTTP-Server-Brick version 0.0.5

$Id$

HTTP::Server::Brick allows you to quickly wrap a prototype web server around some
Perl code. The underlying server daemon is HTTP::Daemon and the performance should
be fine for demo's, light internal systems, etc.

See the POD documentation in the module for more information.

INSTALLATION

To install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Alternatively, run the following commands (Module::Build is still
required, this is just a wrapper):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
